Hi Tor-Willy,

Thanks for the info at the meeting this afternoon. I really appreciate having a much more tech savvy person than me looking into these things!

I had actually made a draft stimuli list for the purposes of testing the platform and piloting the experiment. I’ve attached it in an Excel file, but let me know if another format would be better.

Here are the specifications for the experiment:

STIMULI
There will be 180 words that are presented individually according to the following constraints:
No more than 3 words with the same gender in Spanish can appear consecutively (Gender column in spreadsheet)
No more than 3 words from the same experimental condition can appear consecutively (Condition column in spreadsheet)
NB: Since Gender and Condition are related in the design of this experiment, I am not sure whether both of these constraints will be too restrictive for proper randomization. If this is an issue, the more important constraint is Condition.

PRESENTATION
See sample screen attached
All 180 words would be presented on screens like this one
The font size should probably be about 20; we will have to see how it looks during testing
The colour and text for each of the buttons may change; I will have to look into potential effects of different colours, and I am still trying to decide which labels to use for the buttons. Regardless, the size of the buttons can be established now and if the labels for the buttons do change the longest label would be 4 letters long so that hopefully wouldn’t be a big deal to change later if necessary
Participants can just use one finger from each hand to touch the buttons if they are doing the task on a mobile device (if it is possible to do it on a phone or tablet). If they are doing it on a computer they should use the F and J keys (one key per hand)
Each screen should only be presented for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds, the screen should disappear even if the participant has not responded yet
Before each stimulus screen there should be a fixation cross screen that appears for 500 milliseconds
The fixation cross (+ symbol) should appear in the centre of the text field on the stimulus screen. The point of the fixation cross is to make the participants pay attention to the exact area where the text will appear just before it appears.
After each stimulus screen there should be a blank screen for 500 milliseconds

DATA COLLECTED
Response time from when the stimulus appears on the screen to when the participant selects one of the buttons
Button selected for each stimulus

WISH LIST (just to make it seem less like an experiment and more like one of those kind of silly internet quizzes that are so popular)
Calculate number of correct responses during the task and present a screen with the score and some text at the end. I could specify the correct response for each stimulus if the software could calculate the % of correct answers the participant gave. Then what text is displayed could be specified based on that score, for example, if the score is 50% to 60% then “You have an intermediate level of proficiency in Spanish” or something like that could be displayed.

As I mentioned, there should also be some participant information screens before the experiment itself. These are:
Page with text about the study and a box the participant needs to click to say they agree to participate.
Form they will fill out with information such as age, gender, hometown, languages. Gender and level of education can be a drop-down menus, but rest of the fields should be free text (I can’t remember the technical name for that kind of form).
Spanish proficiency test is a series of questions that have multiple choice answers. Some questions have 4 options, some have 3 options, and some have 2 options.

All the participant information just needs to be recorded, no timing is necessary. Also, all of these additional materials are already available, but I’m not sending them to you yet because I don’t want to send too many things at once and of course having the experiment ready for testing is the most important thing.

As I mentioned during the meeting, I am hoping to pilot at least the draft stimuli while I am away October 6-15. I hope that is not an unreasonable goal – I don’t want to take up too much of your time.

Let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.
